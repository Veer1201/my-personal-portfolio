Portfolio Website Assignment of CMPT 276

## MIT License Explanation

I chose the MIT License for this personal portfolio website because it is a very permissive open-source license. It allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute the code, which aligns with the spirit of sharing knowledge and projects, especially for a portfolio meant to showcase my work to potential employers or collaborators.
